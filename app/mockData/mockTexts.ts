These were the impact on farming and food security, the impact on health and the lack of resilience of health care infrastructure in poorer countries, and finally, the impact on the livelihoods of individuals in poorer countries. Many solutions have been proposed for dealing with climate change. Many of these solutions focus on how to reduce carbon dioxide. The goal is what is known as Net Zero by the year 2050. Net Zero is the idea that the amount of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere should be balanced by the amount of carbon dioxide being removed from the atmosphere. Let’s look at ways we can achieve this. We’ll look at five main ideas: one is renewable energy; another is education; a third is technology transfer; a fourth is luxury carbon taxing; and a final solution is community engagement. Let’s look at how each one works."

        text: "One way we hope to reach net zero by 2050 is through the development of renewable energy. Why is this important? Well, energy needs in developing countries are growing at around 5 percent each year because of economic development and population growth. But right now, you will probably not be surprised to hear that almost 1.3 billion people do not have access to electricity. And 3 billion people cook and heat their homes using wood and animal dung. These both contribute greenhouse gases and cause over 4 million deaths per year due to pollution. It’s obviously a huge challenge to provide the energy needs of so many people so renewable energy seems necessary."
